Quiz game!

This is my first project made using Vanilla Javascript. It's a game for the famous 'Who wants to be a millionaire TV show'. It has the full functionality of the show.
The player can ask the audience for help to a question, phone a friend or use the 50-50 option where 2 wrongs answers are deleted leaving the correct answer and one remaining wrong answer.
